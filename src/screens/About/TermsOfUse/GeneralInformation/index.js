            These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of
            participation that Fanclear may post on the Service) forms the
            entire agreement between you and Fanclear with respect to the
            Service and supersedes any prior agreements or arrangements, be it
            oral or written, between you and Fanclear. In the event of a
            conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, rules and
            conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over the Terms
            to the extent of the conflict.

            Where Fanclear fails to exercise or enforce a right or any provision

            arbitration committee find or consider any of the Terms as invalid,
            the parties, regardless of such fact agree that the court or
            committee should give effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as reflected
            in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in
            full force and have full effect.
